# TicTacToeSquared
A new version of tic-tac-toe! Rules are described here:

Score by playing in the smaller boxes - you start in the center one.
Based on the tile of the small box that you play, the corresponding large tile is the field your opponent can play on.
Once you score in a small field, the large tile becomes yours. Both players can own the same large tile.
When X scores a box, it turns blue. When O scores, it turns yellow. If the box is owned by both players, it becomes green.
If a small field becomes full and a player directs their opponent to that square, they will play in the first large tile with and empty field spot from the top left.

You win by scoring three large tiles in a row! If all 3 tiles are green, it ends in a draw.
