    <p>Hello, nice to see you here. Unless you (somehow) got the wrong URL, (how, I don't know), you have been invited by the one and only, the incredible Ehaab Dhaliwal. Please look around and enjoy your time here.</p>
    <h1>Identity</h1>
    <p>He's not a bird, he's not a plane, and he's certainly not Superman, but he's as close as you'll get. A big-brain 14-year old student and freshman at Eastlake High School. What he lacks in comedy, he makes up for in failure - (there is nothing to compensate for). His companion was a man's dream, his own AI, aptly named "Just A Super Smart Replica Of Ehaab", or JASSROE.</p>
    <h1>Social Media</h1>
    <p>You want to reach this elusive fellow, you say? Well, you have a couple options. You can reach his email at *REDACTED* or his Discord at *REDACTED*. Alternatively, you can call him at *REDACTED*. What, you expected him to actually put his contact information?</p>
