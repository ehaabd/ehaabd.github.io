        <span style="display:block; height: 10"></span>
        <p class="aboutdesc" style="color:white">I've dived into the world of programming and for years I've been honing my skills as a future game developer. I've mastered multiple languages, including C++, Python, Javascript, and C#. (Man, this guy's got some serious talent! clears throat) My free time is dedicated to crafting innovative programming projects and 'appreciating' the accomplishments of my peers in the industry (okay, fine, I play a lot of video games). I'm passionate about music, particularly Punjabi music. One of my monitors is always streaming either A. melodic tunes, B. hilarious comedy shows, C. random tech or gaming videos, or D. some exciting combination of them all. In addition, I'm a piano enthusiast who composes my own original pieces, serving as my unique soundtrack (cue epic OST). And of course, I can't resist immersing myself in the captivating narratives of Marvel, DC, and Star Wars by diving into their comic book and movie universes.</p>
